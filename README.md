# Robotic inference with Nvidia DIGITS for use on Jetson TX2 

Real-time inference of vision system in robotics has recently acquired significant prominence in self-driving cars, drones, agriculture, food grading, warehousing and surveillance systems. These systems require fast and accurate interpretations of the vision data as delays and inconsistencies can have fatal consequences.

This repository is accumpaning the [Active inference for embedded vision systems](https://github.com/Heych88/robond-inference/blob/master/Active%20inference%20for%20embedded%20vision%20systems.pdf) paper.
